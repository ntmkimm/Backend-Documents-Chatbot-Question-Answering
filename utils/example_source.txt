Quân khu 2 của Thái Lan thông báo trên Facebook rằng các cuộc giao tranh hiện đã lan rộng ra 6 khu vực: Prasat Ta Muen Thom, Prasat Ta Kwai, Chong Bok, Khao Phra Wihan (Preah Vihear), Chong An Ma và Chong Chom. Thông báo cho biết một máy bay chiến đấu F-16 đã được triển khai và đã thực hiện không kích vào một vị trí quân sự của Campuchia. Tờ The Nation của Thái Lan đưa tin, F-16 của Thái Lan đã tấn công một căn cứ quân sự của Campuchia gần khu vực biên giới. "Chúng tôi đã sử dụng không lực để tấn công các mục tiêu quân sự theo đúng kế hoạch", đại tá Richa Suksuwanon, phó phát ngôn viên quân đội Thái Lan, nói với phóng viên Channel News Asia.
Thailand, officially known as the Kingdom of Thailand, is a Southeast Asian country located at the heart of the Indochinese Peninsula. It is bordered by Myanmar to the northwest, Laos to the northeast, Cambodia to the southeast, and Malaysia to the south. To the west lies the Andaman Sea, while the Gulf of Thailand borders its eastern coast. Because of its central location in mainland Southeast Asia, Thailand has historically been a crossroads of cultures, trade, and migration, which is still reflected in its diverse society today.

The capital city, Bangkok, is a bustling metropolis that blends centuries-old temples with modern skyscrapers. It is also the political, economic, and cultural center of the nation, home to over ten million people in its greater metropolitan area. Outside of Bangkok, Thailand is often divided into four main regions: the mountainous North, known for its cooler climate and hill tribes; the fertile Central Plains, often called the “Rice Bowl of Asia”; the Northeast (Isan), with its unique Lao-influenced culture and cuisine; and the tropical South, famous for its islands and beaches that attract millions of international tourists each year.

Thailand has a rich cultural heritage deeply rooted in Theravāda Buddhism, practiced by the vast majority of its population. This influence is seen in the thousands of ornate temples across the country, daily rituals, and national festivals such as Songkran (the Thai New Year water festival) and Loy Krathong (the festival of lights). Traditional Thai dance, music, and art remain significant, while Muay Thai (Thai boxing) is both a national sport and a globally popular martial art.

The Thai economy is diverse, with key sectors including tourism, agriculture, manufacturing, and increasingly, technology. It is one of the world’s largest rice exporters, and its tropical fruits—like durians, mangosteens, and rambutans—are globally renowned. Tourism is a major pillar of the economy, with destinations like Chiang Mai, Phuket, Krabi, and Koh Samui drawing visitors for cultural exploration, wellness retreats, and beach holidays.

Politically, Thailand has experienced a complex modern history characterized by frequent changes between military rule and democratic governance. Despite these shifts, the monarchy has remained a deeply revered institution. The current monarch, King Maha Vajiralongkorn (Rama X), is the tenth king of the Chakri Dynasty, which has ruled Thailand since the late 18th century.

Thailand’s cuisine is world-famous, known for its balance of spicy, sour, sweet, and salty flavors. Iconic dishes include Pad Thai, Tom Yum Goong (spicy shrimp soup), Som Tum (papaya salad), and green curry. Street food is an essential part of daily life, and Thai culinary traditions have spread globally, making Thai restaurants a common sight in major cities worldwide.

In recent decades, Thailand has become an important regional hub for travel, trade, and diplomacy. It is a founding member of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and plays a significant role in regional economic and security discussions. With a blend of ancient traditions and modern aspirations, Thailand remains one of the most fascinating and influential countries in Asia.

This influence is seen in the thousands of ornate temples across the country, daily rituals, and national festivals such as Songkran (the Thai New Year water festival) and Loy Krathong (the festival of lights). Traditional Thai dance, music, and art remain significant, while Muay Thai (Thai boxing) is both a national sport and a globally popular martial art.

The Thai economy is diverse, with key sectors including tourism, agriculture, manufacturing, and increasingly, technology. It is one of the world’s largest rice exporters, and its tropical fruits—like durians, mangosteens, and rambutans—are globally renowned. Tourism is a major pillar of the economy, with destinations like Chiang Mai, Phuket, Krabi, and Koh Samui drawing visitors for cultural exploration, wellness retreats, and beach holidays.

Politically, Thailand has experienced a complex modern history characterized by frequent changes between military rule and democratic governance. Despite these shifts, the monarchy has remained a deeply revered institution. The current monarch, King Maha Vajiralongkorn (Rama X), is the tenth king of the Chakri Dynasty, which has ruled Thailand since the late 18th century.

Thailand’s cuisine is world-famous, known for its balance of spicy, sour, sweet, and salty flavors. Iconic dishes include Pad Thai, Tom Yum Goong (spicy shrimp soup), Som Tum (papaya salad), and green curry. Street food is an essential part of daily life, and Thai culinary traditions have spread globally, making Thai restaurants a common sight in major cities worldwide.

In recent decades, Thailand has become an important regional hub for travel, trade, and diplomacy. It is a founding member of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and plays a significant role in regional economic and security discussions. With a blend of ancient traditions and modern aspirations, Thailand remains one of the most fascinating and influential countries in Asia.

Thailand, officially known as the Kingdom of Thailand, is a Southeast Asian country located at the heart of the Indochinese Peninsula. It is bordered by Myanmar to the northwest, Laos to the northeast, Cambodia to the southeast, and Malaysia to the south. To the west lies the Andaman Sea, while the Gulf of Thailand borders its eastern coast. Because of its central location in mainland Southeast Asia, Thailand has historically been a crossroads of cultures, trade, and migration, which is still reflected in its diverse society today.

The capital city, Bangkok, is a bustling metropolis that blends centuries-old temples with modern skyscrapers. It is also the political, economic, and cultural center of the nation, home to over ten million people in its greater metropolitan area. Outside of Bangkok, Thailand is often divided into four main regions: the mountainous North, known for its cooler climate and hill tribes; the fertile Central Plains, often called the “Rice Bowl of Asia”; the Northeast (Isan), with its unique Lao-influenced culture and cuisine; and the tropical South, famous for its islands and beaches that attract millions of international tourists each year.

In recent decades, Thailand has become an important regional hub for travel, trade, and diplomacy. It is a founding member of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and plays a significant role in regional economic and security discussions. With a blend of ancient traditions and modern aspirations, Thailand remains one of the most fascinating and influential countries in Asia.

Thailand, officially known as the Kingdom of Thailand, is a Southeast Asian country located at the heart of the Indochinese Peninsula. It is bordered by Myanmar to the northwest, Laos to the northeast, Cambodia to the southeast, and Malaysia to the south. To the west lies the Andaman Sea, while the Gulf of Thailand borders its eastern coast. Because of its central location in mainland Southeast Asia, Thailand has historically been a crossroads of cultures, trade, and migration, which is still reflected in its diverse society today.

The capital city, Bangkok, is a bustling metropolis that blends centuries-old temples with modern skyscrapers. It is also the political, economic, and cultural center of the nation, home to over ten million people in its greater metropolitan area. Outside of Bangkok, Thailand is often divided into four main regions: the mountainous North, known for its cooler climate and hill tribes; the fertile Central Plains, often called the “Rice Bowl of Asia”; the Northeast (Isan), with its unique Lao-influenced culture and cuisine; and the tropical South, famous for its islands and beaches that attract millions of international tourists each year.

Thailand has a rich cultural heritage deeply rooted in Theravāda Buddhism, practiced by the vast majority of its population. This influence is seen in the thousands of ornate temples across the country, daily rituals, and national festivals such as Songkran (the Thai New Year water festival) and Loy Krathong (the festival of lights). Traditional Thai dance, music, and art remain significant, while Muay Thai (Thai boxing) is both a national sport and a globally popular martial art.

The Thai economy is diverse, with key sectors including tourism, agriculture, manufacturing, and increasingly, technology. It is one of the world’s largest rice exporters, and its tropical fruits—like durians, mangosteens, and rambutans—are globally renowned. Tourism is a major pillar of the economy, with destinations like Chiang Mai, Phuket, Krabi, and Koh Samui drawing visitors for cultural exploration, wellness retreats, and beach holidays.

Politically, Thailand has experienced a complex modern history characterized by frequent changes between military rule and democratic governance. Despite these shifts, the monarchy has remained a deeply revered institution. The current monarch, King Maha Vajiralongkorn (Rama X), is the tenth king of the Chakri Dynasty, which has ruled Thailand since the late 18th century.

Thailand’s cuisine is world-famous, known for its balance of spicy, sour, sweet, and salty flavors. Iconic dishes include Pad Thai, Tom Yum Goong (spicy shrimp soup), Som Tum (papaya salad), and green curry. Street food is an essential part of daily life, and Thai culinary traditions have spread globally, making Thai restaurants a common sight in major cities worldwide.
