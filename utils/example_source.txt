Thailand: A Comprehensive Study
1. Introduction

Thailand, officially known as the Kingdom of Thailand (ราชอาณาจักรไทย – Ratcha Anachak Thai), is one of the most fascinating countries in Southeast Asia, with a unique blend of cultural richness, historical depth, and modern dynamism. Situated in the heart of the Indochinese Peninsula, Thailand occupies a strategic position both geographically and geopolitically, serving as a bridge between the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean, and sharing borders with Myanmar to the west and northwest, Laos to the north and northeast, Cambodia to the southeast, and Malaysia to the south. Its capital city, Bangkok (Krung Thep Maha Nakhon), is not only the nation’s political and economic hub but also a world-renowned metropolis that represents the fusion of tradition and modernity.
